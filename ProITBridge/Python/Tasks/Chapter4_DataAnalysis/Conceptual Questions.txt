My Answers 

1. Python is preferred in the field of Data Science because of its ability to contain less lines of code with lots of inbuilt functions and packages doing the work.
2. Both are IDE's but Jupyter Notebook stores in local storage and whereas Google Collab stores in Cloud storage. 
3. List can be used where the data is suppposed to be immutable, which is , they are often changing. If the data is not going to change, then we can prefer tuple or set. 
4. Exception Handling is done in cases where we know that the program cannot handle this condition and might throw errors and instead of stopping the program, we are handling that using try and catch. Real life examples include, we might have to do calculations in data science and large datasets and if we are dividing and there is a zero present in any one of the data, then it could cause error , there we use zerodivisionerror exception and handle it. Also one more example would be, we might need input from users as particular datatype but we dont get that, then error is thrown and that has to be handled, we use value Error at that place.
5. Dataframe is combination of more than one dimensional. Whereas series is one dimensional.
6. The different ways of dealing with missing data are, approaching the client to provide another proper dataset, if not, then use the existing dataset to arrive at conclusion,if more adhering values are missing, then remove that data from the dataset or else use fillna to fill by using mean and mode so that the dataset isnt affected much. 
7. NumPy often deals with content related to data analysis since it deals with numbers, data cleaning and other works. Whereas, the Pandas differ as it is used for machine learning where algorithms and other stuffs take place.
10. The main important feature of functions in Python is code reusability.

1. Why is Python preferred in Data Science?

Python is preferred because of:

✔ Rich ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
✔ Readability and fast prototyping
✔ Strong community support
✔ Integration with big data tools (Spark, Hadoop)
✔ Production deployment capability
✔ Works across full DS lifecycle (EDA → Modeling → Deployment)

Better answer:

Python is preferred because of its strong ecosystem of data science libraries, ease of prototyping, readability, and its ability to handle the complete data workflow from analysis to model deployment.

2. Jupyter vs Colab

Feature	Jupyter	Colab
Storage	Local	Cloud
GPU	Needs setup	Free GPU/TPU
Collaboration	No	Yes (Google Docs style)
Setup	Manual	Zero setup
Offline use	Yes	No

Mention GPU + collaboration. That’s what interviewers want.

3. List vs Tuple vs Set

Correct logic:
Type	Mutable?	Ordered?	Duplicates?	Use Case
List	Yes	Yes	Yes	Changing data
Tuple	No	Yes	Yes	Fixed records
Set	Yes	No	No	Unique values
Correct framing:

Use list when order matters and data changes.
Use tuple when data should not change.
Use set when uniqueness matters.

4. Exception Handling

Exception handling ensures program continuity even when runtime errors occur.

Add Used in:
File reading
API calls
Database connections
Data parsing

Shows real DS exposure.

5. DataFrame vs Series

Series = 1D labeled array

DataFrame = 2D labeled table made of multiple Series sharing the same index

Mention:
DataFrame is tabular structure like SQL table or Excel sheet.

6. Missing Values

Drop rows/columns
Mean/Median/Mode imputation
Forward/Backward fill
Interpolation
Predictive imputation (KNN / regression)
Flagging missingness as feature
Approaching client is nice but not interview-relevant.

7. NumPy vs Pandas

NumPy	Pandas
Numerical operations	Data manipulation
N-dimensional arrays	Tabular data
Fast math ops	Labelled indexing
Foundation library	Built on NumPy

Machine learning happens in Scikit-learn, not Pandas.

8. Seaborn & Matplotlib

They are used for data visualization.

Matplotlib → Base plotting library

Seaborn → Built on Matplotlib for statistical visualization

Used for:
EDA
Pattern detection
Distribution analysis
Model evaluation visuals

9. .loc vs .iloc
Method	Based on
.loc	Labels
.iloc	Positions

Example:

df.loc['A'] → row with label A
df.iloc[0] → first row

10. Functions

Add:
Functions help with:
Modularity
Reusability
Readability
Debugging
Pipeline building
